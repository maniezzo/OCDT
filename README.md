Optimal Covering Decision Tree

Lots of up to date work and old leftovers

Directories:
- convexhull: old, just a 3d view of a dataset
- data: all datasets. Also a viewer like that in convexhul with a filter for inliers dataset.
- github_cart: a cart from github
- hyperbox: hyperbox AABB clustering. Python older, c++ newer. Works only on small datasets
- interpretableAI: their solution, needs licensing
- MIPmodel: minimal covering cuts. Python older, c++ unfinished stub, c# the real thing, with ortools
- plotTree: reads the cuts and plots the tree. Python older, c++ binary tree, c# nonbinary tree
